Lab Assignment no: 1

String

1. From a given string, print the string in all uppercase if the number of uppercase letters is more than lowercase letters. Otherwise, if lowercase is greater or equal to uppercase letters, print all lowercase. The inputs will contain letters (A-Z, a-z) only.

Sample Input Sample Output

HOusE HOUSE

ApplE apple

BaNaNa banana

2. Given a string, print whether it is a number, word or mixed with digit and letters. If all the characters are numeric values, print NUMBER. If they are all letters, print WORD. If it is mixed, print MIXED.

Sample Input Sample Output

213213 NUMBER

jhg231j213 MIXED

Hello WORD

3. In a given string, there will be two uppercase letters in between some lowercase letters. Print the substring from the first uppercase letter to the last uppercase letter excluding them. If there are no letters in between them, print the word BLANK. It is guaranteed that there will be only two uppercase letters in the string.

Sample Input Sample Output

baNgladEsh glad

coDIng BLANK

4. Write a Python program to find the first appearance of the substring ‘too’ and ‘good’ from a given string. If ‘good’ follows the ‘too’, replace the whole ‘too” good’ substring with ‘excellent’ and print the resulting string. If the above does not appear, print the string as it is.

Sample Input

The book is not too good!

This book is good too!

Sample Output

The book is not excellent!

This book is good too!

5. Create a string from two given strings by concatenating common characters of the given strings.

Sample Input Sample Output

harry, hermione hrrhr

dean, tom

Nothing in common.

6. Again, you have lost your USIS password!! You went to the registrar office and requested for a new password. This time, you need to follow some rules to set your password. Otherwise, they won’t change it. The rules are

At least one lowercase letter At least one uppercase letter

At least one digit (0-9)

At least one special character (_ , $ , #, @)

Your task is to find whether a given password follows all those rules. If it breaks any rule, you have to print Lowercase Missing, Uppercase Missing, Digit Missing or Special Missing respective to the missing case. For more than one rule break, print all the rules that were broken (order doesn’t matter). If the password is ok, print OK.

Sample Input ohMyBR@CU

ohmybracu

OhMyBR@CU20

Sample Output Digit missing

Uppercase character missing, Digit missing, Special character missing

OK

List

1. Write a python program which prints the frequency of the numbers that were given as input by the user. Stop taking input when you find the string “STOP”. Do not print the frequency of numbers that were not given as input.

Sample Input

10

20

20

30

10

50

90

STOP

Sample Output

10 – 2 times

20 – 2 times

30 – 1 times

50 – 1 times

90 – 1 times

2. Write a python program that calculates the sum of N given lists and prints the highest sum and its respective list. Input starts with N and followed by N lists.

Sample Input

4

1 2 3

4 5 6

10 11 12

7 8 9

Sample Output

33

[10, 11, 12]

3. Write a python program that prints a list which contains cross multiplication between two given lists.

Sample Input

2 3 6

3 4 5

Sample Output

[6, 8, 10, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, 30]

Sample Input

Bracu1234 Sample Output acruB1324

4. Let there are N numbers in a list and that list is said to be a UB Jumper if the absolute values of the difference between the successive elements take on all the values 1 through N − 1. For example, 2 1 4 6 10 is a UB Jumper because the absolute differences between them are 1 3 2 4 which is all numbers from 1 to (5 – 1) or 4. Write a python program that takes a number sequence as input and prints whether it is a UB Jumper or Not UB Jumper. Input will stop after getting

“STOP” as input. (Number order or absolute difference order doesn’t follow any sequence.)

Sample Input

1 4 2 3

2 1 4 6 10

1 4 2 -1 6

STOP

Sample Output

UB Jumper UB Jumper

Not UB Jumper

5. You are given a string that contains alphanumeric characters only. Your task is to sort the string in the following manner:

a. All sorted lowercase letters are ahead of uppercase letters.

b. All sorted uppercase letters are ahead of digits.

c. All sorted odd digits are ahead of sorted even digits.

6. BRACU has n students who are regular competitive programmers. According to the ACM ICPC rules, each person can participate in the regional championship at most 5 times.

The head of the BRACU ACM Chapter is recently gathering teams to participate in this championship. Each team must consist of exactly three people, at that, any person cannot be a member of two or more teams. What maximum number of teams can the head make if he wants each team to participate in the world championship with the same members at least k times?

The first line of input contains two integers, n and k. The next line contains n integers: y1, y2, …, yn (0 ≤ yi ≤ 5), where yi shows the number of times the i-th person participated in the ACM ICPC Regional .

Write a python program that prints how many teams can be formed according to the above problem statement.

Sample Input 1

5 2

0 4 5 1 0

Sample Input 2

6 4

0 1 2 3 4 5

Sample Input 3

6 5

0 0 0 0 0 0

Sample Output 1

1

Sample Output 2

0

Sample Output 3

Dictionary &amp; Tuple

1. Write a Python program to combine two dictionaries into one by adding values for common keys. Input contains two comma separated dictionaries. Print the new dictionary and create a tuple which contains unique values in sorted order.

Sample Input

a: 100, b: 100, c: 200, d: 300 a: 300, b: 200, d: 400, e: 200

Sample Output

{‘a’: 400, ‘b’: 300, ‘c’: 200,’d’: 700, ‘e’: 200} Values: (200, 300, 400, 700)

2. Write a python program which prints the frequency of the numbers that were given as input by the user. Stop taking input when you find the string “STOP”. Do not print the frequency of numbers that were not given as input. Use a dictionary to solve the problem

Sample Input

10

20

20

30

10

50

90

STOP

Sample Output

10 – 2 times

20 – 2 times

30 – 1 times

50 – 1 times

90 – 1 times

3. Write python code to invert a dictionary. It should print a dictionary where the keys are values from the input dictionary and the values are lists of keys from the input dictionary having the same value. Make sure the program handles multiple same values.

Sample Input

key1 : value1, key2 : value2, key3 : value1

Sample Output

{ “value1” : [“key1”, “key3”], “value2” : [“key2”] }

4. Two words are anagrams if they contain all of the same letters, but in a different order. For example, “evil” and “live” are anagrams because each contains one “e”, one “i”, one “l”, and one “v”.

Write a program that reads two strings from the user and determines whether or not they are anagrams. Use a dictionary to solve the problem.

Sample Input

evil live

Sample Output

Those strings are anagrams.

5. On some basic cell phones, text messages can be sent using the numeric keypad. Because each key has multiple letters associated with it, multiple key presses are needed for most letters. Pressing the number once generates the first character listed for that key. Pressing the number 2, 3, 4 or 5 times generates the second, third, fourth or fifth character.

Key Symbols

2 ABC

3 DEF

8 TUV

9 WXYZ
